# Building an AI-Powered Chatbot: From Gemini to OpenAI

During my internship at **CyberJall Infotech**, I had the opportunity to build an AI-powered chatbot from scratch. This project taught me valuable lessons about API integration, backend architecture, and the importance of clean code design.

## The Challenge

The goal was to create an intelligent chatbot that could handle user queries efficiently and provide relevant responses. We started with Google's Gemini API, but soon realized we needed to migrate to OpenAI's APIs for better performance and features.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing conversation history
- **ORM**: Prisma for better query structure and type safety
- **AI APIs**: Initially Gemini, later migrated to OpenAI

## Key Learnings

### 1. API Design Matters

Clean, well-structured APIs make debugging and maintenance significantly easier. I learned to:

- Follow RESTful conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Use middleware for authentication and validation

### 2. Database Optimization

Using Prisma ORM improved our query performance and code maintainability. Type-safe database queries reduced runtime errors significantly.

### 3. Migration Strategy

Migrating from Gemini to OpenAI taught me the importance of:

- Writing modular, adaptable code
- Proper abstraction layers
- Comprehensive testing before production deployment

## The Result

The chatbot successfully handled user interactions with improved response quality and faster processing times. Working with cross-functional teams to debug issues and enhance reliability was an invaluable learning experience.

## Conclusion

This project reinforced my belief that building real-world applications is the best way to learn. Theory is important, but nothing beats hands-on experience with production-level code.
