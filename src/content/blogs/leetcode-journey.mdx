# My LeetCode Journey: 200+ Problems and Counting

When I started solving problems on LeetCode, I had no idea how transformative it would be for my programming skills. What began as exam preparation turned into a daily habit that significantly improved my problem-solving abilities.

## Why LeetCode?

As a Computer Engineering student, understanding Data Structures and Algorithms isn't optional—it's essential. LeetCode provided the perfect platform to:

- Practice different problem patterns
- Learn optimal solutions
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Track my progress over time

## My Approach

### 1. Start with Easy Problems

I began with easy-level problems to build confidence. Understanding basic patterns in:

- Arrays and Strings
- Hash Tables
- Two Pointers technique

### 2. Move to Medium Complexity

Once comfortable, I tackled medium-level problems involving:

- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Binary Search variations
- Recursion and Backtracking

### 3. Contest Participation

Participating in LeetCode contests taught me to:

- Think under time pressure
- Optimize solutions quickly
- Handle edge cases efficiently

## Languages Used

I primarily solve problems in **Java** and **JavaScript**, sometimes using **SQL** for database problems. This multilingual approach helps me understand different language paradigms and their strengths.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: Solving 2-3 problems daily is better than marathon sessions
2. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on patterns, not just solutions
3. **Multiple Solutions**: Try to find both brute force and optimized approaches
4. **Learn from Others**: Reading discussions after solving helps discover new techniques

## Current Stats

- **Problems Solved**: 200+
- **Topics Covered**: Arrays, Hashing, Trees, Graphs, DP, Recursion
- **Contest Participation**: Regular biweekly contests

## The Impact

LeetCode practice directly helped me during my internship interviews and while working on real-world projects. The logical thinking and optimization skills transfer directly to production code.

## What's Next?

I'm currently focusing on:

- Advanced Dynamic Programming
- Graph algorithms
- System Design concepts
