# My Journey into Full-Stack Development

Starting out as a Computer Engineering student at PCET's PCCoE, Pune, I never imagined how quickly the world of web development would captivate me. What began as curiosity turned into a passion for building scalable applications and solving real-world problems.

## The Beginning

My journey started with the fundamentals - Data Structures and Algorithms. Spending hours on LeetCode, solving problems involving arrays, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming taught me not just how to code, but how to think algorithmically. Each solved problem was a small victory that built my confidence.

## First Steps in Development

Learning JavaScript changed everything. The ability to build both frontend and backend with a single language felt powerful. I dove deep into:

- **React.js** for building interactive UIs
- **Node.js & Express** for creating RESTful APIs
- **MongoDB** for database management

## Real-World Experience

My internships at **CyberJall Infotech** and **Libity Infotech** were transformative. Building an AI-powered chatbot, integrating Prisma ORM, and working with production-level codebases taught me more than any tutorial could.

## Current Focus

Now, as Head Web Developer at OWASP PCCoE and having led development for Anantya Techfest, I'm focused on:

- Mastering modern frameworks like Next.js
- Building scalable backend architectures
- Contributing to open-source projects

## What's Next?

The learning never stops. I'm excited to explore more advanced topics like microservices, cloud deployment, and system design. Stay tuned for more posts about my projects and learnings!
